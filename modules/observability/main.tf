# Two defects in the previous LoadBalancer-scoped p95 alarm, both of which paged for
# things nobody could act on:
#
#  1. The ALB is SHARED across products, so a LoadBalancer-only dimension aggregated
#     rally and opshub into one p95 and named the result after whichever product's
#     stack created it. `target_unhealthy` above already scopes per target group for
#     exactly this reason; latency now matches.
#
#  2. A percentile over a handful of samples is not a percentile. On a pre-launch or
#     low-traffic environment (measured: 0-6 requests per 5-minute period) p95 IS
#     effectively the second-slowest single request, so ONE slow request held the
#     alarm over the threshold for three consecutive periods and paged. That is noise
#     that trains people to ignore the alarm, which is worse than no alarm.
#
# The metric-math expression suppresses the evaluation below `alb_latency_min_requests`
# requests per period by returning 0 — chosen over a composite alarm because it stays
# one resource with one history to read, and over raising the threshold because a high
# threshold hides a real regression under load instead of ignoring an idle environment.
# Missing RequestCount (a target group serving nothing publishes no datapoint) combines
# with `notBreaching` below, so silence still reads as OK rather than as a breach.
